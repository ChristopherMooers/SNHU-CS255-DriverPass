# DriverPass System Design

## Project Overview
The DriverPass project was developed for a client seeking a web-based platform that helps students prepare for their driving tests. The system allows students to register for lessons, access online learning materials, and track progress. It also enables instructors to manage schedules and communicate with students efficiently.

## Reflection

**What did I do particularly well?**  
I effectively documented clear business requirements and system design elements that connected user needs to technical features. My UML diagrams and use cases clearly communicated how different user types interact with the system.

**If I could revise one part of my work, what would I improve?**  
I would enhance the database design section with more detailed entity-relationship diagrams and normalization explanations. This would help future developers maintain data integrity and scalability.

**How did I interpret and implement the user‚Äôs needs?**  
I translated user stories‚Äîlike booking lessons, viewing progress, and accessing learning materials‚Äîinto system components such as class diagrams and data flow diagrams. This ensured that every design choice aligned with actual client goals.

**Why is it important to consider user needs?**  
Meeting user needs directly affects usability and adoption. A system that addresses real-world problems and expectations leads to higher satisfaction and better performance outcomes.

**How do I approach designing software?**  
I use an iterative design process: gathering requirements, creating UML models, validating with stakeholders, and refining based on feedback. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate more agile practices and modular design strategies for flexibility and collaboration.
